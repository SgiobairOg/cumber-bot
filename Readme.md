Whether you know him as Dr. Who, Sherlock, Khan, Smaug or any of his other characters you've most likely encountered a random combination of three-syllable words that made you think of him. Alexa has no idea who he is but if you ask she'll do her best to remember his name—-armed with dictionaries of three-syllable B and C words.

Please report any issues here. Thanks!

Special thanks to [NorfolkJS](https://norfolkjs.org) and @lynnaloo for getting me started.
